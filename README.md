# FEMALE FRIEND FINDER

THIS WAS NOT A GOOD HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT AT THIS POINT IN THE CLASS.

THE FOCUS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON ROUTES AND EXPRESS RATHER THAN SO MUCH TIME NEEDED FOR MATCHMAKING LOGIC WITHOUT A DATABASE.

CONSIDERING ALL THE NEW SERVER-SIDE MATERIAL OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, THERE IS A TON OF STUFF MORE IMPORTANT THAN MATCHMAKING LOGIC RIGHT NOW.


I GOT THE ROUTES TO WORK AND I GOT HEROKU TO WORK.   I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD MATCHMAKING LOGIC BUT THEN IT THE JAVASCRIPT ARRAY METHODS DID NOT WORK AS I PLANNED.

AGAIN THERE ARE SO MANY MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO FOCUS ON RIGHT NOW THAN TRYING TO MANIPULATE USING AN ARRAY RATHER THAN DATABASE.


## SO BASICALLY

1. USER ENTERS VALUES 1 TO 5
2. GOES TO SERVER.JS, 
3. THEN API ROUTES (WHERE MATCHMAKING LOGIC IS DONE), 
4. THEN HTML ROUTES, 
5. BACK AS A DATA CALLBACK PARAMETER WHICH IS A JSON OBJECT SENT THROUGH RES.JSON


PATH MODULE AND THE HTML ROUTES I HAVE NOT LEARNED ENOUGH ABOUT YET AT ALL.

ALTHOUGH I GOT IT TO WORK I NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT "res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "../public/survey.html"));" DOES


I ALSO DON'T KNOW WHY THE INSTRUCTIONS DID NOT WANT BODY PARSER MODULE INSTALLED.



I REMOVED THE NODE_MODULES FOLDER AFTER DOING AN NPM INSTALL TO GET DEPENDENCIES INSERTED IN PACKAGE.JSON FILE; BEACAUSE HEROKU DOES NOT WANT NODE_MODULES FOLDER.


2 FEMALES WERE ADDED TO THE FRIENDS ARRAY OBJECT FILE:  1. ELIZABETH HURLEY AND 2. ALYSSA MILANO.  

THE FRIENDS LIST UPDATE WORKS, IF YOU ADD A USER AND CLICK ON THE FRIENDS LIST IT GETS UPDATED.

## EVERY DAY I SEE MORE AND MORE WHY I LOVE FIREBASE!!!!!
