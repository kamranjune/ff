# FEMALE FRIEND FINDER


WHOLLY MOLLY THAT WAS NOT EASY TO DO IN 5 HOURS

I THINK THE MATCHMAKING LOGIC IS RIGHT

THE ROUTES NEED TO BE RIGHT TOO.


IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO SPEND LESS TIME ON THE MATCHMAKING LOGIC AND MORE TIME ON LEARNING PATH AND USING PATHS.

## SO BASICALLY

1. USER ENTERS VALUES 1 TO 5
2. GOES TO SERVER.JS, 
3. THEN API ROUTES (WHERE MATCHMAKING LOGIC IS DONE), 
4. THEN HTML ROUTES, 
5. BACK AS A DATA CALLBACK PARAMETER WHICH IS A JSON OBJECT SENT THROUGH RES.JSON


PATH MODULE AND THE HTML ROUTES I HAVE NOT LEARNED ENOUGH ABOUT YET AT ALL.

I ALSO DON'T KNOW WHY THE INSTRUCTIONS DID NOT WANT BODY PARSER MODULE INSTALLED.


I REMOVED THE NODE_MODULES FOLDER AFTER DOING AN NPM INSTALL TO GET DEPENDENCIES INSERTED IN PACKAGE.JSON FILE; BEACAUSE HEROKU DOES NOT WANT NODE_MODULES FOLDER.


2 FEMALES WERE ADDED TO THE FRIENDS ARRAY OBJECT FILE:  1. ELIZABETH HURLEY AND 2. ALYSSA MILANO.  (I HOPE I WOULD MATCH WITH ELIZABETH HURLEY ALTHOUGH 20 YEARS YOUNGER.)
